          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access to and use of the
          Services made available by Snapify, Inc. By using our Services, you
          agree to be bound by these Terms. If you use our Services on behalf of

          Terms, and you represent that you have the authority to do so.

        <h2 className="my-5 text-lg font-bold">1. Snapify’s Services</h2>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <strong>1.1 Registration. </strong>Snapify provides video messaging
          services for work. Upon registration, a user must either create a new
          Workspace or join an existing Workspace. If a user creates a new
          Workspace on behalf of themselves, the user is the Customer. If a user
          creates a new Workspace on behalf of an organization (such as the
          user’s employer), the organization is the Customer. Customers can
          invite Authorized Users to their Workspace and must designate at least
          one Authorized User to be an Administrator, who will manage and
          control the Workspace. If a user joins an existing Workspace created
          by another person or organization, that person or organization is the
          Customer and the user is an Authorized User. All Customers,
          Administrators, and Authorized Users must comply with these Terms.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <strong>1.2 Access. </strong>During the Subscription Term, Customer
          may access and use, and may allow Authorized Users to access and use
          the Services for its business purposes in accordance with these Terms.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <strong>1.3 Software. </strong>Snapify may make Software available as
          part of the Services. Subject to these Terms, Snapify grants to
          Customer and its Authorized Users a limited non-exclusive,
          non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to download and use the
          Software to the extent necessary to use the Services. Software may
          update automatically. To the extent a component of the Software
          contains any open source software, the open source license for that
          software will govern with respect to that component.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <strong>1.4 Restrictions. </strong>Customer will not and will ensure
          Authorized Users do not: (a) reproduce, modify, adapt, or create
          derivative works of the Services; (b) rent, lease, distribute, sell,
          transfer, or sublicense the Services to a third party except as
          permitted in these Terms; (c) interfere with, disrupt, or circumvent
          any security measures or mechanisms designed to protect the Services;
          (d) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or seek to obtain or
          derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, or
          non-public APIs of Services; (e) remove or obscure any proprietary or
          other notices contained in the Services; (f) harass, threaten, spam or
          cause distress, unwanted attention, or discomfort to a person or
          entity; (g) impersonate or falsely state or misrepresent an
          affiliation with anyone; (h) use the Services to transmit any viruses,
          worms, trojan horses, or other harmful or malicious code or programs;
          (i) use the Services to build competitive products; or (j) misuse the
          Services in any way, including in violation of these Terms or
          applicable law. Any use of data mining, robots, or similar data
          gathering and extraction tools or framing all or any portion of the
          Services without Snapify’s permission is strictly prohibited. Customer
          will prevent, terminate, and notify Snapify of any unauthorized or
          illegal use of or access to its or any Authorized User account or the
          Services.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <strong>1.5 Corporate Domains. </strong>If a user creates a Workspace
          using an email address belonging to their employer or organization,
          that account may be added to the organization&apos;s Workspace, in
          which case Snapify will provide notice to the user or Administrator of
          the account, so they can help facilitate the transfer of their
          account. The Administrator of the Workspace will have the ability to
          control that account, which includes being able to access, modify, or
          remove information from the account, modify user roles, and delete or
          restrict access to the account. Customers and Authorized Users agree
          to comply with their organization’s terms and policies regarding use
          of the Service.
        </p>
        <h2 className="my-5 text-lg font-bold">2. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <strong>2.1 Authorized Users. </strong>Customer is responsible for
          Authorized Users’ use of the Services and their compliance with these
          Terms. Customer will ensure that all Authorized Users are over the age
          of 13 or the applicable age of digital consent, whichever is older.
          Customer represents that it has obtained all consents necessary for
          Customer and its Authorized Users’ use of the Services, including
          Customer’s ability to convert accounts previously registered by
          individuals using Customer’s business email domain into Authorized
          User accounts.
        </p>

          ensuring all Customer Data and any other content or information
          provided to Snapify or uploaded, posted, recorded, or transmitted to
          the Services complies with these Terms. If any Customer Data violates
          these terms, Snapify may ask Customer to remove or edit the Customer
          Data so it is no longer in violation, or Snapify may, but is not
          obligated to, remove the Customer Data or take action as needed to
          resolve the issue.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <strong>2.3 Third-Party Apps. </strong>Third-Party Apps are subject to
          their own terms and privacy policies. Customer is responsible for
          reviewing those terms and policies before using Third-Party Apps.
          Snapify is not responsible for Third-Party Apps and does not warrant
          or support them. By enabling a Third-Party App that uses or accesses
          Customer Data, Customer authorizes the transfer of that data to the
          Third-Party App and, if applicable, will ensure that there is a
          legally valid data transfer mechanism for the transfer or onward
          transfer, in accordance with all applicable privacy and data
          protection laws.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <strong>2.4 Prohibited Content. </strong>Customer will not and will
          ensure Authorized Users do not upload, post, record, or transmit any

          Snapify or the Services, including content that: (a) is threatening,
          abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, discriminatory, or
          hateful; (b) infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright
          or other intellectual property right or violates the rights of others
          in any way; (c) contains pornography or sexually explicit material;
          (d) is harmful to minors; or (e) promotes or provides instructional
          information about illegal activities or promotes physical harm or
          injury to any group or individual.

          process and use Customer Data: (a) to provide, protect, and update the
          Services, (b) to enforce these Terms and exercise its rights
          hereunder, (c) as required by law, and (d) as otherwise instructed by
          Customer. Snapify may collect and use Customer Data on an aggregated
          and/or anonymized basis for Snapify’s internal business purposes;
          provided that Snapify will not use or share this data in a way that
          identifies any individual or Customer as the source of the data.

          <strong>4.1 Fees. </strong>Customer agrees to pay the Fees in
          accordance with the payment terms set forth on the Order. Customer is
          responsible for paying applicable Taxes.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <strong>4.2 Renewals. </strong>Unless otherwise stated on an Order,
          each Subscription Term will automatically renew, unless Customer
          cancels their subscription at least 60 days prior to renewal. Customer
          authorizes Snapify to charge Customer’s credit card on file or invoice
          Customer for each renewal until Customer cancels their subscription.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <strong>4.3 Downgrades. </strong>If Customer fails to pay Fees when
          they are due, Snapify may downgrade Customer to a free plan upon
          reasonable notice. If Customer is downgraded, Customer will lose
          access to certain features or functionality, but these Terms will
          continue to apply.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <strong>4.4 Price Changes. </strong>If Snapify increases its pricing,
          Snapify will provide at least 30 days’ prior notice, and the new

          employees, agents, or contractors who need to know it and who are
          bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective of
          Confidential Information as those described in this section. The
          recipient will be responsible for those parties’ breach of this
          section. A breach of this section may cause irreparable harm and
          entitle the disclosing party to injunctive relief.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-5">
          <strong>5.3 Required Disclosure.</strong> The recipient may disclose
          Confidential Information to the extent required by law, provided that
          the recipient uses reasonable efforts to notify the disclosing party
          in advance and gives them an opportunity to contest the disclosure
          (except as described in Section 8). Confidential Information disclosed
          pursuant to this section will otherwise still be subject to the
          confidentiality obligations described above.

          Customer a prorated refund of prepaid fees for the remainder of the

          have full control and authority over the defense, except that: (a) any
          settlement that does not include a complete release of the indemnified
          party from all liability or that imposes any admission, obligation, or
          restriction on the indemnified party requires prior written consent,
          not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (b) the indemnified
          party may join in the defense with its own counsel at its own expense.
          The indemnities above are Customer’s only remedy for infringement of
          third-party intellectual property rights.
